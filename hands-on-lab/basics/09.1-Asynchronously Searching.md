You work as a system administrator who is tasked with collecting all system log events pertaining to SSH. For this, you will need to create an asynchronous search request to run in the background to search against the filebeat-7.13.4 dataset for log messages that mention SSH. The asynchronous search should be configured to not wait for completion by setting the wait_for_completion_timeout parameter to 0 and should return a hits array size of 100. You will need to check the status of the async search request to check for completion. Once it is completed, get the results, and then delete the async search.

You work as a cybersecurity threat hunter who is being tasked with importing a list of malicious URLs into Elasticsearch so that you can compare them with outgoing requests made from your company's network. First, you will need to download the malicious_urls.zip archive and extract the malicious_urls.csv file. Then, you will need to import the dataset into the malicious_urls index using the Data Visualizer in Kibana.

Because you are working on a single-node cluster, the malicious_urls index should be configured with 1 primary and 0 replica shards in order to maintain a green cluster state.

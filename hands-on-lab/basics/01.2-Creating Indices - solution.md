Introduction

Before you can ingest any data into Elasticsearch, you first need to construct indices for a particular dataset. In this hands-on lab, you will get to define indices in a pre-built Elasticsearch environment in order to prepare the cluster to ingest some data.

Solution


Create the leads_b2b-000001 Index
In the Kibana console, delete the default GET request that is auto-populated.

Verify that all nodes are up and running:

GET _cat/nodes?v
Press Cmd + Enter to execute the request.

Your single-node cluster should be returned in the response pane, indicating that it is up and running.

Craft a request to create an index named leads_b2b-000001that has 1 primary shard and 0 replica shards:

PUT leads_b2b-000001
{
  "settings": {
    "number_of_shards": 1,
    "number_of_replicas": 0
  }
}
Press Cmd + Enter to execute the request.

Insert a few new lines above the PUT request.

First, check the health of the cluster to verify that the index was created successfully with the proper replication configured to maintain a green status:

GET _cat/health?v
Press Cmd + Enter to execute the request.

The cluster should display in the response pane with green status, indicating it was created and configured successfully.

Then, check the status of all the indices on the cluster to verify the index's individual status:

GET _cat/indices?v
Press Cmd + Enter to execute the request.

The leads_b2b-000001 index should display in the list of indices with green health, 1 primary shard, and 0 replicas, indicating it was created and configured successfully.

Create the leads_b2c-000001 Index
Insert a few new lines above the commands you used to create the leads_b2b-000001 index.

Craft a request to create an index named leads_b2c-000001that has 1 primary shard and 0 replica shards:

PUT leads_b2c-000001
{
  "settings": {
    "number_of_shards": 1,
    "number_of_replicas": 0
  }
}
Press Cmd + Enter to execute the request.

Select the GET _cat/indices?v command to verify that the index was created successfully with the proper replication configured to maintain a green status.

Press Cmd + Enter to execute the request.

The leads_b2c-000001 index should display in the list of indices with green health, 1 primary shard, and 0 replicas, indicating it was created and configured successfully.

Create the sales_b2c-000001 Index
Insert a few new lines above the commands you used to create the leads_b2c-000001 index.

Craft a request to create an index named sales_b2c-000001that has 1 primary shard and 0 replica shards:

PUT sales_b2c-000001
{
  "settings": {
    "number_of_shards": 1,
    "number_of_replicas": 0
  }
}
Press Cmd + Enter to execute the request.

Select the GET _cat/indices?v command to verify that the index was created successfully with the proper replication configured to maintain a green status.

Press Cmd + Enter to execute the request.

The sales_b2c-000001 index should display in the list of indices with green health, 1 primary shard, and 0 replicas, indicating it was created and configured successfully.

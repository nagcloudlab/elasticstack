Lab Scenario
You are a site reliability engineer who is proof-of-concepting the use of the Elastic Stack to collect, store, and analyze system telemetry data. To facilitate this endeavor, you need to first create the following index templates in Elasticsearch to properly format the telemetry data indices:

'load' for indices that start with "load-"
'cpu' for indices that start with "cpu-"
'memory' for indices that start with "memory-"

Since this is a single-node cluster, you will need to configure the index templates to create all indices with 1 primary and 0 replica shards to ensure the indices that use these templates are allocated with a green state.

Introduction

When working with time-series or data streaming use cases, you typically want to spread your data out into multiple indices as to not make an index too large and incur performance penalties as a result. By using index templates, we can instantiate an index for a given dataset very quickly and even automatically. In this hands-on lab, you will get to create index templates in Elasticsearch in order to prepare the cluster to ingest continuously generated time-series data.

Solution


Create the Load Index Template
In the Kibana console, delete the default GET request that is auto-populated.

Verify that all indices have been allocated properly:

GET _cat/indices?v
Create index template:

PUT _index_template/load
Press Cmd + Enter to execute the request.

All indices should be returned in the response pane with green health and open status.

Execute the following:

{ "index_patterns": ["load-*"], "template": { "settings": { "number_of_shards": 1, "number_of_replicas": 0 } } }
Execute the PUT:

Cmd + Enter
Insert a new line above the PUT command to verify template:

GET _index_template/load
Execute the command:

Cmd + Enter
Create the CPU Index Template
Insert a new line below the GET _cat/indices?v command:
PUT _index_template/cpu
Execute the following:
{ "index_patterns": ["cpu-*"], "template": { "settings": { "number_of_shards": 1, "number_of_replicas": 0 } } }
Execute the PUT:
Cmd + Enter
Insert a new line above the PUT command to verify template:
GET _index_template/cpu
Execute the command:
Cmd + Enter
Verify the patterns are working correctly:
PUT cpu-1
Execute the PUT:
Cmd + Enter
Create the Memory Index Template
Insert a new line below the GET _cat/indices?v command:
PUT _index_template/memory
Execute the following:
{ "index_patterns": ["memory-*"], "template": { "settings": { "number_of_shards": 1, "number_of_replicas": 0 } } }
Execute the PUT:
Cmd + Enter
Right click on the wrench and from the dropdown menu, click Auto indent.
Insert a new line above the PUT command to verify template:
GET _index_template/memory
Verify the patterns are working correctly:
PUT cpu-1
Execute the PUT:
Cmd + Enter

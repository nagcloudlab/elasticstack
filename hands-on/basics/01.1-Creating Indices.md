Lab Scenario

You are a system administrator who is in charge of all the Elasticsearch clusters at your company. The business intelligence office wants to ship some sales and leads data to a single-node proof of concept cluster for some testing. You will need create the following indices for them:

leads_b2b-000001
leads_b2c-000001
sales_b2c-000001

Since this is a single-node cluster, each index should be created with 1 primary and 0 replica shards in order to maintain a green cluster state.

You are a systems administrator who is tasked with aggregating Apache webserver access logs. For this, you have an Elasticsearch instance on which you will need to create the apache_stream data stream to prepare the cluster to continuously index and rollover the Apache log indices. However, before you can create a data stream, you first need to define the apache_policy index lifecycle management (ILM) policy and the apache_template index template as follows:

ILM Policy: apache_policy

rollover at a maximum primary shard size of 5gb.
forcemerge rolled over indices into 1 segment.
Set rolled over indices to readonly.
delete indices with a minimum age of 90 days.
Index Template: apache_template

Uses the apache_stream data stream.
Uses the apache_policy ILM policy.
Creates indices with 1 primary and 0 replica shards.
Once the apache_policy ILM policy and the apache_template index template are created, start and verify the apache_stream data stream.

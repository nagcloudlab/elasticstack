Lab Scenario

You are a system administrator who is using multiple Elasticsearch clusters to gather observability data from different geographical regions. You've been tasked with establishing cross-cluster search amongst your 3 clusters so that they can all be queried from 1 cluster. You will need to configure the es1 cluster to cross-cluster search both the es2 and es3 clusters. To test this, you should query the metricbeat-7.13.4 dataset on es2 and es3 from es1 to make sure cross-cluster search is working as expected.
